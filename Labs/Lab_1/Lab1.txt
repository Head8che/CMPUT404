4.What is the difference between the virtual environment and the not virtual environment python?
The virtual environment creates a isolated python environment, which contains the necessary libraries, scripts and executables to use for the project. It is used to manage python packages for different projects. A non virtual environment in python will put installed packages along side the python interpreter, which will allow a single version of a given package to be installed with the python installation. This will cause issues when different projects require its own different set of python packages/dependencies.
